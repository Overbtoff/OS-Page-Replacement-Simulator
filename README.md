# Operating System Page Replacement Simulator

## Why this Project

This is the 4th (also the final) **Experiment in Collaboration** for Operating System course of IMU.

## About this Project

An interactive web application that visualizes page replacement algorithms in operating systems,especially FIFO、LRU、LFU、OPT.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Step-by-step simulation of page replacement algorithms with a dynamic table display.
- **Algorithm Implemented**: 
  - FIFO
  - LRU
  - LFU
  - OPT
- **Intuitive Graphics and Animation**: Ability to watch each step or process automatically of the Intuitive Algorithms Simulation. Also the Intuitive graphics,which can watch and download.
